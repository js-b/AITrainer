# AITrainerProject
This is your own AI Personal trainer which counts the perfect bicep curls you perform so that you don't get to keep a count of those half bicep curls which you perform when you get tired and also shows the percentage of completion of a bicep curl. We use mediapipe and opencv-python.
numpy is used to create the bar and calculating the angle of your arm as wll as calculating the percentage of completion of the curl.<br>
  The AiTrainer.py is the main file to be executed and the PoseEstimationModule.py is the module accessed to make our life easier. <br>Happy Coding!!<br>

  Following is the output of our goals.
